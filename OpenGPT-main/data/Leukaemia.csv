"<|user|> What causes acute myeloid leukaemia? <|eos|> <|ai|> It is not clear what causes acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), but the myeloid stem cells produce more white blood cells than are needed. The white blood cells produced are still immature, so they do not have the infection-fighting properties of fully developed white blood cells. As the number of immature cells increases, the amount of healthy red blood cells and platelets decrease, and it's this fall that causes many of the symptoms of leukaemia.
